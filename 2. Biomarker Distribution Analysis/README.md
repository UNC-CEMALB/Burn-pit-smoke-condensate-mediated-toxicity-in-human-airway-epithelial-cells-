# Biomarker Friedman Analysis (Table S2-S5)
- Testing for statistical differences across burn conditions (control, smoldering, and flaming) for each individual biomarker (mRNAs or cytokines) within low (1ug/cm2) and high (25ug/cm2) doses after a various exposure durations (4, 24, or 72 hours)
- Used a Friedman's test (non-parametric test for 3+ group comparisons) followed by Nemenyi's post hoc tests
